        <p>Here's a list of what you will find on my Github repositories:</p>

<h3>
<a id="university-stuff" class="anchor" href="#university-stuff" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>University stuff</h3>

<p>These contain assignments and final projects for many of the subjects I took for my Computer Science degree.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/elopez/EDyA-I">EDyA-I</a> - Data structures and algorithms</p>

<p>This repository has a diff tool and a VCS tool I created during my second year on University, as my final assignment for the data structures and algorithms course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/elopez/AC">AC</a> - Computer architecture</p>

<p>This repository contains a mini virtual machine I made as my final assignment for the computer architecture course on my second year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/elopez/SO-I">SO-I</a> - Parallelism and concurrency</p>

<p>Here you'll find a very simple distributed pseudo-filesystem I did as final course assignment for <em>Operating Systems I</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/elopez/SO-II">SO-II</a> - Operating systems </p>

<p>During the course, we completed many of the original Nachos (Not Another Completely Heuristic Operating System) assignments. You will find them here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/elopez/IAA">IAA</a> - Machine learning</p>

<p>This course consisted on analyzing datasets with different tools and algorithms. You'll find the results, as well as useful scripts and programs I did during the course on this repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/elopez/ICCyFLP">ICCyFLP</a> - Quantum computing</p>

<p>You'll find some solutions to quantum computing exercises in here. I took this course on the second half of 2016.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="floss-projects" class="anchor" href="#floss-projects" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FLOSS projects</h3>

<p>I have contributed to several FLOSS projects, you'll find some of them here.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/elopez/enablewhatsappweb">enablewhatsappweb</a> - "Enable WhatsApp Web" Firefox addon</p>

<p>Once upon a time, WhatsApp's Web client was artificially limited to Chrome only. This Firefox addon skipped that check. It is kept here purely for historical value, as the WhatsApp client has been Firefox-compatible for a long time now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/elopez/linux">linux</a> - Linux kernel</p>

<p>I have contributed dozens of patches to the Linux kernel. This repository contains some old and new, mostly work-in-progress patches I may or may not have upstreamed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/elopez/keybinder">keybinder</a> - simple keybinding program</p>

<p>This is a small program I created to bind commands to keypresses. I used it together with Allwinner's old Consumer IR driver, which emulated a keyboard to expose remote control button presses to userspace.</p>
