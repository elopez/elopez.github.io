  "body": "Here's a list of what you will find on my Github repositories:\r\n\r\n### University stuff\r\n\r\nThese contain assignments and final projects for many of the subjects I took for my Computer Science degree.\r\n\r\n* [EDyA-I](https://github.com/elopez/EDyA-I) - Data structures and algorithms\r\n\r\n  This repository has a diff tool and a VCS tool I created during my second year on University, as my final assignment for the data structures and algorithms course.\r\n\r\n* [AC](https://github.com/elopez/AC) - Computer architecture\r\n\r\n  This repository contains a mini virtual machine I made as my final assignment for the computer architecture course on my second year.\r\n\r\n* [SO-I](https://github.com/elopez/SO-I) - Parallelism and concurrency\r\n\r\n  Here you'll find a very simple distributed pseudo-filesystem I did as final course assignment for _Operating Systems I_.\r\n\r\n* [SO-II](https://github.com/elopez/SO-II) - Operating systems \r\n\r\n  During the course, we completed many of the original Nachos (Not Another Completely Heuristic Operating System) assignments. You will find them here.\r\n\r\n* [IAA](https://github.com/elopez/IAA) - Machine learning\r\n\r\n  This course consisted on analyzing datasets with different tools and algorithms. You'll find the results, as well as useful scripts and programs I did during the course on this repository.\r\n\r\n* [ICCyFLP](https://github.com/elopez/ICCyFLP) - Quantum computing\r\n\r\n  You'll find some solutions to quantum computing exercises in here. I took this course on the second half of 2016.\r\n\r\n### FLOSS projects\r\n\r\nI have contributed to several FLOSS projects, you'll find some of them here.\r\n\r\n* [enablewhatsappweb](https://github.com/elopez/enablewhatsappweb) - \"Enable WhatsApp Web\" Firefox addon\r\n\r\n  Once upon a time, WhatsApp's Web client was artificially limited to Chrome only. This Firefox addon skipped that check. It is kept here purely for historical value, as the WhatsApp client has been Firefox-compatible for a long time now.\r\n\r\n* [linux](https://github.com/elopez/linux) - Linux kernel\r\n\r\n  I have contributed dozens of patches to the Linux kernel. This repository contains some old and new, mostly work-in-progress patches I may or may not have upstreamed.\r\n\r\n* [keybinder](https://github.com/elopez/keybinder) - simple keybinding program\r\n\r\n  This is a small program I created to bind commands to keypresses. I used it together with Allwinner's old Consumer IR driver, which emulated a keyboard to expose remote control button presses to userspace.",
