  "body": "Here's a list of what you will find on my Github repositories:\r\n\r\n### University stuff\r\n\r\nThese contain assignments and final projects for many of the subjects I took for my Computer Science degree.\r\n\r\n* [EDyA-I](https://github.com/elopez/EDyA-I) - Data structures and algorithms\r\n\r\n  This repository has a diff tool and a VCS tool I created during my second year on University, as my final assignment for the data structures and algorithms course.\r\n\r\n* [AC](https://github.com/elopez/AC) - Computer architecture\r\n\r\n  This repository contains a mini virtual machine I made as my final assignment for the computer architecture course on my second year.\r\n\r\n* [SO-I](https://github.com/elopez/SO-I) - Parallelism and concurrency\r\n\r\n  Here you'll find a very simple distributed pseudo-filesystem I did as final course assignment for _Operating Systems I_.\r\n\r\n* [SO-II](https://github.com/elopez/SO-II) - Operating systems \r\n\r\n  During the course, we completed many of the original Nachos (Not Another Completely Heuristic Operating System) assignments. You will find them here.\r\n\r\n* [IAA](https://github.com/elopez/IAA) - Machine learning\r\n\r\n  This course consisted on analyzing datasets with different tools and algorithms. You'll find the results, as well as useful scripts and programs I did during the course on this repository.\r\n\r\n* [ICCyFLP](https://github.com/elopez/ICCyFLP) - Quantum computing\r\n\r\n  You'll find some solutions to quantum computing exercises in here. I took this course on the second half of 2016.\r\n\r\n### FLOSS projects\r\n\r\nI have contributed to several FLOSS projects, you'll find some of them here.\r\n\r\n* [enablewhatsappweb](https://github.com/elopez/enablewhatsappweb) - \"Enable WhatsApp Web\" Firefox add-on\r\n\r\n  Once upon a time, WhatsApp's Web client was artificially limited to Chrome only. This Firefox add-on skipped that check. It is kept here purely for historical value, as the WhatsApp client has been Firefox-compatible for a long time now.\r\n\r\n* [linux](https://github.com/elopez/linux) - Linux kernel\r\n\r\n  I have contributed [dozens of patches](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits/master?author=elopez) to the Linux kernel. This repository contains some old and new, mostly work-in-progress patches I may or may not have upstreamed.\r\n\r\n* [keybinder](https://github.com/elopez/keybinder) - simple keybinding program\r\n\r\n  This is a small program I created to bind commands to keypresses. I used it together with Allwinner's old Consumer IR driver, which emulated a keyboard to expose remote control button presses to userspace.\r\n\r\n### ACM-ICPC and other programming competitions\r\n\r\n* [eldiego](https://github.com/elopez/eldiego) - ICPC team notebook\r\n\r\n  This is the notebook (ie., collection of algorithms) we use while competing on ICPC-style events.\r\n\r\n* [competition-boilerplate](https://github.com/elopez/competition-boilerplate) - ICPC competition templates and makefiles\r\n\r\n  As typing the same code over and over gets tedious fast, I have a set of makefiles and a preset template program I use on practice sessions.\r\n\r\n* [codeforces](https://github.com/elopez/codeforces) - Solutions to Codeforces rounds\r\n\r\n  The idea here was to upload all the solutions to the Codeforces rounds I've participated in, but I never got around to doing so, so this repository is fairly incomplete. You will find the actual programs on Git tags, they are not on a branch.\r\n\r\n### Others\r\n\r\ndotfiles and prezto are public copies of the configuration files I use on my ZSH and other programs. c4.5 is a cleaned up version of an old program, used on machine learning to generate decision trees. dtschecker is an abandoned project which intended to validate the semantics of Linux device tree files. Pintos is a mirror of the Pintos educational operating system framework, which I intend to complete someday. Finally, carpeta-jcc contains LaTeX documents used to generate printed material that was handed out during a yearly computer science congress that takes place at my University.",
